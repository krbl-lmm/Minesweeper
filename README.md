# Minesweeper (C++)

This is a collaborative project to build the classic **Minesweeper** game from scratch using **C++**. It is created and developed by me and my friend **krbl-lmm**. Our goal is to implement all the game mechanics, including the grid, mine placement, user input, and win/loss conditions.
